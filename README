tslime.vim

This is a simple vim script to send portion of text from a vim buffer to a
running tmux session.

It is based on slime.vim http://technotales.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/like-slime-for-vim/,
but use tmux instead of screen.

However, compared to tmux, screen doesn't have the notion of panes. So, the
script was adapt to take panes into account.

For now, you need to have tmux build from cvs if you want to paste to a
specified pane since the current version (1.2) doesn't support it.

If you can't / don't want to build from source, you can use the stable branch.
The version available in that branch isn't aware of panes so it will paste to
pane 0 of the window.
